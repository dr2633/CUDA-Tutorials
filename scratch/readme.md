## About This Guide
If you're a Python developer or AI engineer allergic to C++ (stuffy nose and watery eyes when looking at curly braces), but find yourself tempted to dive deeper into CUDA and GPU programming - you're in the right place! This guide is built to make GPU programming accessible to those comfortable in the safe space of the Python ecosystem, helping you bridge the gap between high-level ML frameworks and hardware-level optimization. Think of it as your friendly prompt to venture beyond `torch.cuda` and write your own GPU kernels! ðŸ’ª
