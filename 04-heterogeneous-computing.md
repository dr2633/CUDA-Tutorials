## **1. Key Concepts and Definitions**

### **1.1 Heterogeneous Programming**
1. **Definition**:
    - A programming model where computations are distributed across different types of processors, such as CPUs (host) and GPUs (device).

2. **Host and Device Roles**:
    - **Host (CPU)**:
        - Manages the program execution.
        - Allocates and transfers memory.
        - Launches kernels on the device.
    - **Device (GPU)**:
        - Executes computationally intensive parallel tasks.
        - Operates as a coprocessor to the host.

3. **Implications for Programming**:
    - Programmers must manage memory and data transfer between the host and device explicitly, except when using Unified Memory.
    - CUDA APIs facilitate interaction between host and device memory spaces.

### **1.2 Separate Memory Spaces**
1. **Host Memory**:
    - DRAM accessible only by the host CPU.
    - Used for non-parallel sections of the application and data preparation.

2. **Device Memory**:
    - DRAM accessible only by the GPU.
    - Includes global, constant, texture, and shared memory.

3. **Unified Memory**:
    - **Definition**: A single, coherent memory space accessible by both CPU and GPU.
    - **Benefits**:
        - Simplifies data management by eliminating the need for explicit memory copies.
        - Supports oversubscription of device memory.

## **2. Modern NVIDIA Hardware and Heterogeneous Programming**

### **2.1 Advances in NVIDIA GPUs**
1. **Support for Unified Memory**:
    - Enabled by hardware with Compute Capability 6.0 and above.
    - Allows seamless access to managed memory across multiple GPUs and CPUs.

2. **NVLink**:
    - High-bandwidth interconnect that improves communication between GPUs and between the CPU and GPU.
    - Reduces latency for data transfers in heterogeneous systems.

3. **Compute Capability 9.0**:
    - Introduces Thread Block Clusters, allowing even greater cooperation between thread blocks.
    - Enhances distributed shared memory (DSM) to support advanced synchronization primitives.

### **2.2 Benefits of Heterogeneous Programming**
1. **Performance**:
    - Offloads intensive parallel tasks to the GPU, freeing the CPU for sequential operations.
    - Optimized for tasks like deep learning, simulation, and rendering.

2. **Flexibility**:
    - Unified Memory simplifies porting existing applications to CUDA by minimizing changes to data structures and memory management.

    2. Perform matrix multiplication across multiple GPUs using `cudaSetDevice()`.
- **Benchmark**:
    - Measure the speedup achieved with NVLink-enabled GPUs.

### **3.3 Memory Oversubscription**
- **Goal**: Explore memory oversubscription using Unified Memory.
- **Steps**:
    1. Allocate managed memory exceeding the GPUâ€™s physical memory.
    2. Access the memory from both host and device.
- **Benchmark**:
    - Measure the impact of memory oversubscription on performance.
